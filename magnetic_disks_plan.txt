Data & Storage talk (20'):
| Data: client-side, server-side.
| Operational vs backup/archive data
| Data is often business critical - can't tolerate loss or unavailability
| Amount of data increasing over time: mobile devices, connectivity, "cat videos"
| Data types: file-based, vs. databases (structured/unstructured).
| Resides on spinning magnetic disks, SSD, tape (backup/archive)
| Directly attached IDE, SATA, SCSI, SAS. 
| Rise of the data centre, 1/2/3U rack server, blade servers.
| Storage depends on hardware: need redundancy! RAID, ZFS, JBOD, other stuff.
| Virtualisation
| Cloud (and self-provisioning)
| Move away from server-centric storage.
| NAS - remote filesystem: heterogenous networks, common management.
| SAN - remote block device: no need for any commonality beyond protocol.
| Advantages but needs management: dedup, replication, centralised backup, encryption at rest.
| Legislation: FOI (government), GDPR (everyone).
